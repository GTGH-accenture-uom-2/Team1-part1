# Vaccination Recording System - PART 1
The establishment of a system for the organisation and registration of vaccinations is requested.
Insured citizens can search and book vaccination appointments, while the doctors can declare a vaccination. 

More specifically, 
+ Insured citizens are vaccinated at a vaccination centre of their choice.
+ Each vaccination centre has a series of vaccination slots at a specific day, time, and minutes where vaccination takes place.
+ The insured citizen searches for free time slots at a selected vaccination centre and selects a desired time slot.
+ If he changes his mind he can change the desired time slot selection.
+ The insured citizen is vaccinated by the doctor who is declared to serve the selected time slot at the specific vaccination centre of the slot.
+ Every insured citizen can be informed if they have vaccination coverage in force.
+ Each doctor can be informed of upcoming vaccination appointments per vaccination centre and per day.
