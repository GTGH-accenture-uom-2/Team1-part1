# Vaccination Recording System - PART 1
The establishment of a system for the organisation and registration of vaccinations is requested.
Insured citizens can search and book vaccination appointments, while the doctors can declare a vaccination. 

More specifically, 
+ Insured citizens are vaccinated at a vaccination center of their choice.
+ Each vaccination center has a series of vaccination slots at a specific day, time, and minutes where vaccination takes place.
+ The insured citizen searches for free timeslots at a selected vaccination center and selects a desired timeslot.
+ If he changes his mind he can change the desired timeslot selection.
+ The insured citizen is vaccinated by the doctor who is declared to serve the selected timeslot at the specific vaccination center of the slot.
+ Every insured citizen can be informed if they have vaccination coverage in force.
+ Each doctor can be informed of upcoming vaccination appointments per vaccination center and per day.
